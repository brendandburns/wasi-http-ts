Experimental HTTP client for typescript and WebAssembly

This is a client for the [experimental HTTP + WebAssembly support](https://github.com/brendandburns/wasmtime) that I
have added to [wasmtime](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime). It should not be considered production
ready and may change at any time.

It is also derived from the previous work from [@deislabs](https://github.com/deislabs/wasi-experimental-http) and will likely be reintegrated there eventually.

## Using
For now you need to manually install this code your self, I'll get it into npm eventually...
